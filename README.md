# netscape-theme
A Netscape style theme for Firefox

HORRIBLY OUTDATED! Will not work on modern Firefox.

Archived because:
- modern Firefox has made it unusable
- I was a child when I made this and my code is likely unreliable and filled with hacks
- If I ever do update it, it will be a complete rewrite
